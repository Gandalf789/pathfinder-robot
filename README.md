  ## 1. Installing Webots
  - On Linux, run the command `sudo apt install webots` in terminal to install the Webots app.
  - On Windows, install the official executable file from the [Webots website](https://cyberbotics.com/) and run it.

  ## 2. Extracting the .zip file
  Extract the .zip file. It contains two folders:
  - `worlds` folder containing the world files
  - `controllers` folder with the actual source code for the controller of the e-puck
    
  ## 3. Opening the world file
  To open the world file of this particular simulation you have to first 
  1. open Webots,
  then 
  2. go to `File` and
  3. click the `Open World` button.
  4. navigate then in the location where you extracted the .zip file
  5. go to `Worlds` and
  6. select one of the two simulation.

     
  ## 4. Before running the simulation
  be sure to give running permission to the executable of the code.
  To do this simply 
  - open up a console
  - type `$cd /location_of_the_extracted_folder/controllers/Comenzi`
  - then to give executing permission type `chmod u+x Comenzi`

  ## 5. Running the simulation
  To run the simulation simply click the play button from the above or press _Ctrl+2_
  
  To increase the speed of the simulation press the button next to the play button or _Ctrl+3_

  A console should pop-up in the bottom of the screen, if not, it can be activated using _Ctrl+N_
