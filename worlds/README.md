## About the enviroment

### 1. The mazes

The mazes are composed from blocks of `MazeBlock.proto`, that can be found 

[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyberbotics/webots/R2023b/projects/samples/robotbenchmark/maze_runner/protos/MazeBlock.proto)

The mazes were randomly generated on https://www.mazegenerator.net with the width and height otion of 8,

then manually constructed, block by block, in Webots.

### 2. Editing the world

To edit the maze simply click on a block and move it with the arrows.
